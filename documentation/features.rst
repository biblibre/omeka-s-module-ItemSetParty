Features
========

This module creates a resource hierarchy based on one or more item sets defined in its configuration.

On the admin side, you'll see a dynamic display, i.e. linked resources will appear when clicked on non-grayed resources (i.e. with 'hasPart' relationships).
The special feature on the admin side is the ability to load a sidebar with resource data.

On the site side, there are two possibilities: 
- The first is a display through the navigation, rendered as the dynamic equivalent of the admin view.
- The other, via the block, is a static rendering with a predefined depth.
