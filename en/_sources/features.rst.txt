Features
========

This module creates a resource hierarchy based on one or more item sets defined in its configuration.

Admin side
----------

Here you'll see a dynamic display, i.e. linked resources will appear when clicked on non-grayed resources (i.e. with 'hasPart' relationships).

The special feature on the admin side is the ability to load a sidebar with resource data.

Site side
----------

There are two possibilities:

- The first is a display through the navigation, rendered as the dynamic equivalent of the admin view.

- The other, via the block, is a static rendering with a predefined depth.
